<summary><h2>Step 3: Customize your homepage</h2></summary>

_Nice work setting the theme! :sparkles:_

You can customize your homepage by adding content to either an `index.md` file or the `README.md` file. GitHub Pages first looks for an `index.md` file. Your repository has an `index.md` file so we can update it to include your personalized content.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create your homepage

1. Browse to the `index.md` file in the `my-pages` branch.
1. In the upper right corner, open the file editor.
1. Type the content you want on your homepage. You can use Markdown formatting on this page.
1. (optional) You can also modify `title:` or just ignore it for now. We'll discuss it in the next step.
1. Commit your changes to the `my-pages` branch.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.

<summary><h2>Step 4: Create a blog post</h2></summary>

_Your home page is looking great! :cowboy_hat_face:_

GitHub Pages uses Jekyll. In Jekyll, we can create a blog by using specially named files and frontmatter. The files must be named `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`. You must also include `title` and `date` in your frontmatter.

**What is _frontmatter_?**: The syntax Jekyll files use is called YAML frontmatter. It goes at the top of your file and looks something like this:

```yml
---
title: "Welcome to my blog"
date: 2019-01-20
---
```

For more information about configuring front matter, see the [Jekyll frontmatter documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a blog post

1. Browse to the `my-pages` branch.
1. Click the `Add file` dropdown menu and then on `Create new file`.
1. Name the file `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
1. Replace the `YYYY-MM-DD` with today's date, and change the `title` of your first blog post if you'd like.
   > If you do edit the title, make sure there are hyphens between your words.
   > If your blog post date doesn't follow the correct date convention, you'll receive an error and your site won't build. For more information, see "[Page build failed: Invalid post date](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/troubleshooting-jekyll-build-errors-for-github-pages-sites)".
1. Type the following content at the top of your blog post:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "YOUR-TITLE"
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   ---
   ```
1. Replace `YOUR-TITLE` with the title for your blog post.
1. Replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with today's date.
1. Type a quick draft of your blog post. Remember, you can always edit it later.
1. Commit your changes to your branch.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.
